IP could be as of host or as of subnet

See examples below:

	delete 193.70.18.123	- without slash, delete host ip (not ip of subnet)

Note that we delete IP as it in list - i.e.
if we has IP of subnet and IP of host from this subnet and we call delete subnet IP 
then only IP on subnet will deleted from list`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// whitelistDeleteCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// whitelistDeleteCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
